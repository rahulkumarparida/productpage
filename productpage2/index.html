            The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,[2][3] which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent
            all-wheel drive system.[2] It was introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. Production
            ended in the first quarter of 2024.The car is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's
            private subsidiary company manufacturing high performance automotive parts, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly
            quattro GmbH),[4] and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the Huracán platform.[5] The
            fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame,[2] and uses an aluminium monocoque
            which is built using space frame principles. The car is built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated
            factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.[2] At the time it was introduced in 2006, the
            R8 became the first production car with full-LED headlamps

            The RS5 weighs 1,800 kg (3,968 lb), with 56.3 percent at the front and 43.7 in the rear which makes it prone
            to understeer, however Audi has added two electro-mechanical systems to counter its nose-heaviness. The
            stability-control system attempts to stop front-end plow before it happens by squeezing the brakes on the
            inside wheels which effectively drag those tires enough to pull the car into the corner.

            The RS5 also has an active rear differential that can apportion power between the rear wheels to create a
            similar effect, or even oversteer; in normal conditions, quattro all wheel drive delivers 60% of the
            engine’s torque rearward and rising to as much as 85 percent depending on conditions.
